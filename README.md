# JS_CSS_VARS_APP

Updating a variable in CSS is a common practise now a day.  
On the page, I've got three variables spacing, blur and base color 
and when I change one of those like spacing it will just immediately 
update wherever that variable is changed on the page same with blur 
I'm only using that on this imagery here but as I change it, 
it's going to update and then finally base color I'm using it 
for the background of this image as well as the color of this JS highlight 
here so when I change that color it updates everywhere is reference on the actual page.
